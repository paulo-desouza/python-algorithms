# TREES 

# A tree data structure has a root, branches & leaves 

# has its roots at the top and its leaves on the bottom 
# properties: 
# - one node is ROOT.
# - Every node n, except for the ROOT node, is connected byu an edge from exactly one another node p, where p is the parent of n.
# - A unique path traverses from the root to each node. 
# - if each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we call that a binary tree.
# - all children of one node are independent of the children of another node.
# - each leaf node is unique.

# file systems are a tree data structure

# EDGE : connects two nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. 
# Every node (except for the root) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges.
# these are the connections that form the PATH!

# PATH : Ordered list of nodes connected by edges . 

# CHILDREN: A set of nodes that have INCOMING EDGES from the same node (MotherNode) are the children of this node.

# SIBLINGS: Nodes of the same parent.

# SUBTREE: Set of parents and siblings

# LEAF NODE: Node that has no children.

# LEVEL OF A NODE: represents how deep the node is in the tree structure. ('/etc' = level 1, '/home/user/Downloads' = level 3)

# HEIGHT OF A TREE: Maximum level on any node on a tree.
